# Cursor Rules for MySQL Terraform Directory

## CRITICAL: Remote Execution Only
- **NEVER run terraform commands locally** in this directory
- **ALWAYS use SSH to bastion host** for any terraform operations
- This directory contains MySQL Terraform that requires RDS connectivity
- RDS is in private subnet and only accessible from bastion host

## Required Workflow
1. Use `./deploy.sh` to copy files and run terraform on bastion
2. Or manually SSH to bastion and run terraform there
3. Never run `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, etc. locally

## Bastion Connection
- IP: 63.32.182.69 (update as needed)
- User: ec2-user
- Key: ~/.ssh/trigpointing-bastion.pem

## Commands to Use
```bash
# Deploy from local (recommended)
./deploy.sh

# Or manual SSH approach
ssh -i ~/.ssh/trigpointing-bastion.pem ec2-user@63.32.182.69
cd /home/ec2-user/mysql-terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## What This Directory Contains
- MySQL database schemas (production, staging)
- MySQL users (production, staging, backups)
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- RDS connection via bastion host only
