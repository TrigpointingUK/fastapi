# Third-Party API Integration Guide

This guide explains how third-party applications can integrate with the TrigpointingUK API using Auth0 for authentication and authorisation.

## Overview

Third-party applications can access the TrigpointingUK API on behalf of users through delegated authorisation. This allows external apps, mobile applications, or services to:

- Read public trigpoint data
- Create and update logs and photos on behalf of users
- Access trig statistics and geolocation services

**Important**: Third-party apps cannot access user PII (email addresses, real names) or modify user profiles directly. This protects user privacy whilst enabling a vibrant ecosystem.

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Mobile App Integration (Recommended)

For mobile apps that act on behalf of a user:

1. **Register your application** in Auth0 as a Native Application
2. **Request user authorisation** using OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE
3. **Use granted scopes** to access the API on the user's behalf

**Granted scopes**:
- `api:write` - Create/update logs, photos, trigs for the authorised user
- Public read access (implicit with authentication)

**NOT granted**:
- `api:read-pii` - Cannot access user email addresses or real names
- `api:admin` - Cannot modify other users' data

### 2. Server-to-Server Integration (M2M)

For trusted server applications requiring direct API access:

1. **Contact administrators** to discuss your use case
2. **M2M client credentials** may be provided for approved integrations
3. **Limited scopes** granted based on integration requirements

This pattern is less common and requires manual approval.

## Step-by-Step: Mobile App Integration

### 1. Register Your Application

Contact the TrigpointingUK administrators with:
- Application name and description
- Callback URLs (e.g., `com.yourapp://callback`)
- Logout URLs
- Website/app store links

You'll receive:
- Client ID
- Auth0 domain (e.g., `auth.trigpointing.uk`)

### 2. Implement OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

**Initiate authorisation**:
```
GET https://auth.trigpointing.uk/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=com.yourapp://callback&
  scope=openid profile api:write&
  state=RANDOM_STATE&
  code_challenge=CODE_CHALLENGE&
  code_challenge_method=S256
```

**Exchange code for token**:
```
POST https://auth.trigpointing.uk/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
redirect_uri=com.yourapp://callback&
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
code_verifier=CODE_VERIFIER
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "scope": "openid profile api:write"
}
```

### 3. Use Access Token for API Calls

Include the access token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..." \
  https://api.trigpointing.uk/api/v1/trigs
```

### 4. Example: Create a Log Entry

```bash
POST https://api.trigpointing.uk/api/v1/logs
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "trig_id": 12345,
  "logged_date": "2025-10-23",
  "condition": "G",
  "comment": "Logged via MyAwesomeApp"
}
```

The log will be created under the authorised user's account.

## Scope Reference

| Scope | Description | Granted to 3rd Party |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `api:write` | Create/update own logs, photos, trigs | ✅ Yes |
| `api:read-pii` | Access user PII (email, realName) | ❌ No |
| `api:admin` | Administrative access | ❌ No |

## API Endpoints Available to Third-Party Apps

### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required)
- `GET /api/v1/trigs` - List all trigpoints
- `GET /api/v1/trigs/{id}` - Get trigpoint details
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}/badge` - Get user badge image

### Authenticated Endpoints (With `api:write` Scope)
- `POST /api/v1/logs` - Create log entry
- `PATCH /api/v1/logs/{id}` - Update own log entry
- `DELETE /api/v1/logs/{id}` - Delete own log entry
- `POST /api/v1/photos` - Upload photo
- `PATCH /api/v1/photos/{id}` - Update own photo
- `GET /api/v1/users/me` - Get own user profile (public fields only)

### Restricted Endpoints (NOT Available)
- `PATCH /api/v1/users/me` - Update user profile (requires `api:read-pii`)
- `POST /api/v1/users` - Create users (internal only)

## Best Practices

### 1. Respect User Privacy
- Never attempt to scrape or infer PII
- Only request scopes you actually need
- Display clear privacy policies to users

### 2. Handle Token Expiry
- Access tokens expire after 24 hours
- Implement token refresh using refresh tokens
- Handle 401 responses gracefully

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Be respectful of API resources
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Cache responses where appropriate

### 4. Error Handling

Common error responses:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 401 | Unauthorised | Token expired or invalid - re-authenticate |
| 403 | Forbidden | Missing required scope - request correct permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limited - back off |

### 5. Branding
- Clearly indicate your app is "powered by TrigpointingUK"
- Use official logos and branding (available on request)
- Link back to trigpointing.uk

## Security Considerations

### Do's ✅
- Use PKCE for mobile apps (prevents authorisation code interception)
- Store tokens securely (iOS Keychain, Android KeyStore)
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Validate token expiry before each request
- Log out users properly (clear tokens)

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't store tokens in plaintext
- Don't hardcode client secrets in mobile apps (use PKCE instead)
- Don't share access tokens between users
- Don't attempt to reverse-engineer or bypass scopes

## Example Integrations

### Mobile App (React Native)
```javascript
import { authorize } from 'react-native-app-auth';

const config = {
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  redirectUrl: 'com.yourapp://callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'api:write'],
  serviceConfiguration: {
    authorizationEndpoint: 'https://auth.trigpointing.uk/authorize',
    tokenEndpoint: 'https://auth.trigpointing.uk/oauth/token',
  },
};

const authState = await authorize(config);
// Use authState.accessToken for API calls
```

### Python Script
```python
import requests
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session

client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8080/callback'
authorization_base_url = 'https://auth.trigpointing.uk/authorize'
token_url = 'https://auth.trigpointing.uk/oauth/token'

# Get authorisation URL
oauth = OAuth2Session(client_id, redirect_uri=redirect_uri, scope=['api:write'])
authorization_url, state = oauth.authorization_url(authorization_base_url)
print(f'Visit: {authorization_url}')

# After user authorises, exchange code for token
callback_response = input('Paste callback URL: ')
token = oauth.fetch_token(token_url, authorization_response=callback_response)

# Use token for API calls
response = requests.get(
    'https://api.trigpointing.uk/api/v1/trigs',
    headers={'Authorization': f"Bearer {token['access_token']}"}
)
```

## Changelog

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I create user accounts via the API?**  
A: No, user registration is handled through Auth0 directly. Third-party apps can only act on behalf of existing users.

**Q: Why can't I access user email addresses?**  
A: To protect user privacy, the `api:read-pii` scope is reserved for first-party applications. Third-party apps can access public profile information (username, stats) but not contact details.

**Q: Can I build a competing mobile app?**  
A: Yes! The API is designed to encourage an open ecosystem. Build the best app you can - competition benefits users.

**Q: How do I get M2M client credentials?**  
A: Contact administrators with your use case. M2M access is granted on a case-by-case basis for legitimate integrations.

**Q: Will the API always be free?**  
A: The API is currently free for all users. If commercial rate limits are ever introduced, hobbyist/community projects will remain free.
